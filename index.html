          <p>
            The sea turtle is among the most fascinating creatures that Sri Lanka is home to because it is one of the world's many endangered species. 
            Sea turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's western coast frequently see a sizable number of them. 
            The sea turtles travel to the hatcheries during their molting cycle by swimming through the vast Indian Ocean.

          <h2 id="subTitle">What is a hatchery?</h2>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>
            A hatchery is a facility where eggs are hatched under artificial conditions, especially those of fish, poultry or even turtles.
            It may be used to breed rare or endangered species under controlled conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, turtle hatcheries are dedicated facilities that protect turtle eggs from natural predators and human threats, 
            providing a controlled environment for incubation. The hatchery ensures optimal conditions for the eggs to hatch, 
            and once the hatchlings emerge, they are nurtured until they are strong enough to be released into the wild. 
            Turtle hatcheries play a crucial role in conserving and protecting endangered sea turtle species, helping to boost their survival rates.

          <h2 id="subTitle">What makes turtles different from tortoises?</h2>
          <hr>
          <br>
            <p>
              The shells of the turtles and tortoises differ. The Carapace or top part of the shell of the turtles is streamlined and short making swimming easy.
              On the other hand the shell of the tortoise is thick and more useful for their protection. 
              The plastron or under shell of the two species differ in the same manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another difference is that turtles have broad, flattened flippers whilst tortoises have short cylindrical limbs. 
              The flippers facilitate swimming greatly but make it very difficult for females to move on the beaches where they come back to nest.

          <h2 id="subTitle">Why Turtles Deserve Attention</h2>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>
            Turtles are important for several reasons, playing significant roles in ecosystems and benefiting both the environment and human societies. 
            Turtles have diverse ecological roles that help maintain the balance of ecosystems. 
            For instance, freshwater turtles help control populations of aquatic plants, algae, and invertebrates, 
            contributing to the overall health of freshwater ecosystems. Sea turtles help regulate the populations of jellyfish, 
            seagrass beds, and coral reefs, influencing the structure and function of marine ecosystems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turtles can serve as indicators of the overall health and quality of ecosystems. 
            Their presence or absence can reflect changes in water quality, habitat degradation, or pollution levels. 
            Monitoring turtle populations and their behavior can provide valuable insights into the overall ecological condition of an ecosystem.

        <h2>Turtles In Sri Lanka</h2>
        <aside>
          <div id="list1">
            <p>
              Sri Lanka is home to several fascinating species of turtles, making it a significant nesting ground and a haven for turtle conservation.
              These turtle species face numerous challenges, including habitat destruction, pollution, poaching, 
              and accidental entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation initiatives, such as protected nesting sites, hatcheries, 
              and awareness campaigns, play a crucial role in safeguarding these turtles and their habitats in Sri Lanka. 
              There are five main types of turtles which can be found along the Sri Lankan coastline:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Green Sea Turtle</li>
              <li>Leatherback Sea Turtle</li>
              <li>Olive ridley Sea Turtle</li>
              <li>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</li>
              <li>Loggerhead Sea Turtle</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div id="list2">
            <p>
              Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka play a vital role in the conservation and protection of endangered sea turtles. 
              These hatcheries are dedicated facilities that aim to safeguard turtle eggs and ensure the survival of hatchlings 
              until they are ready to be released into the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka are instrumental in the conservation efforts to protect and restore sea turtle populations. 
              They serve as sanctuaries for these vulnerable creatures, offering them a fighting chance against the numerous threats 
              they encounter. By supporting and visiting these hatcheries, individuals can actively contribute to the 
              conservation of sea turtles and help secure their future in the oceans. The three main turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hikkaduwa</li>
              <li>Bentota</li>
              <li>Kosgoda</li>
